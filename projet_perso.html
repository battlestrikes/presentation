<h1>My professional project</h1>
<p>My study objective is to successfully complete my 3 years of R&T and then integrate directly into professional life as a system and network administrator. This goal of becoming a network administrator appeared during my internship (<a href="présentation.html">see presentation</a>). I chose this job because it's a job where you have to help people when they have problems with their computer for example, and doing that in a field that I really like (computer science) is something that I really want to do in the future.I obviously keep the idea of ​​becoming a musician but it requires a lot of time so I might as well already have an achievable goal in mind (becoming a system and network administrator) and see by working hard on the side if it's possible to transform <a href="centres_d'intérets.html">my hobby</a> into a profession</section
